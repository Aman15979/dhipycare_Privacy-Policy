                    2.1.3 Information submitted voluntarily through forms, profile updates, or feedback is retained as

                    2.2 Medical & Health Information (Sensitive Data)

                    2.2.1 Medical information is collected only for diagnosis, treatment planning, service execution, or

                    concerns, and
                    clinical assessments.

                    2.2.3 We classify medical data as Sensitive Data and treat it with stricter confidentiality
                    measures.

                    2.2.4 Users voluntarily submitting health-related details acknowledge the need for such data for
                    accurate
                    service delivery.

                    2.2.6 No medical information is shared externally without lawful reason or explicit user
                    authorization.

                    2.2.7 Data related to treatment feedback, recovery summary, or service outcome may be recorded to

                    2.2.9 Users may request removal of their medical records subject to retention rules under applicable

                    human
                    oversight.

                    collected
